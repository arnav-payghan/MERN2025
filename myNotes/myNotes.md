# MERN Stack

###### M - MongoDB
This is the database for the program. NoSQL database, i.e JSON format.
We store our data.

###### E - Express
This is the Web Framework.
Web Framework? It is a ready-to-use toolbox for building web apps faster and more easily.
Why? Because it saves time, more clean and organized and handles common tasks (such as routing and error handling).

###### R - React
This will be our frontend library.

###### N - Node
Node is the Runtime, or it helps in the backend servers.
Runs Javascript on the server. (Normally would run on localhost, but node makes it on the server.)

> Beauty is that we only use JavaScript. No other languages needed.
